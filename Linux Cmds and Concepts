CONCEPTS:
You can define variables like in other coding launguages. For example, Fruit=Apple would store the word Apple in the variable Fruit.
To get the value of a variable, put $ before the variable. 

When using mathmatical operations, you must leave a space between the characters. Ex: 4 + 4.

To read user input, use the 'read' command. You can flag the read command with -p to create a message for the user.
Ex: read -p "How old are you?" <age_variable>

There are 6 main operators; -eq = Equal to, -ge = Greater than equal to, -gt = Greater than, -le = Less than equal to, -lt = less than, -ne = Not equal to. 

Conditional Statments used in bash; if...then...fi; if...then...else...fi; if..elif..else..fi
You can also use and (-a) and or (-o) for comparisons. 

You can automate scripts using cron jobs.
