--Information about Bash and Linux Scripting--

What is BASH? A bash script is a combination of commands stored in a file which are executed at once by the bash program.

The Linux scripts here were ran with wsl on a Windows computer; which is a subsystem for Linux available on the Windows OS but it must be downloaded.
All scripts can be ran on a normal Linux computer.

BASH is pretty similar to Python when it comes to logic and syntax.
