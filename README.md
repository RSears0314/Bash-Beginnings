--Information about Bash and Linux Scripting--

What is BASH? A bash script is a combination of commands stored in a file which are executed at once by the bash program.

[username@host ~]$ - The shell is waiting for a command from the user
[root@host ~]#     - The shell is running as root

To create a BASH file:
1. 'touch <nameyourscripthere>.sh' to create the file
2. 'which bash' to find where your bash shell is located
3. 'chmod u+x <scriptname>' to give the user execution rights for the file
4. './<scriptname>' or 'bash <scriptname>' to run the script
