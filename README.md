--Information about Bash and Linux Scripting--

What is BASH? A bash script is a combination of commands stored in a file which are executed at once by the bash program.

[username@host ~]$ - The shell is waiting for a command from the user.
[root@host ~]#     - The shell is running as root.

The Linux scripts here were ran with wsl on a Windows computer; which is a subsystem for Linux available on the Windows OS but it must be downloaded.
